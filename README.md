## Reflection

- I really struggled with the assignment this week and there were a lot of new concepts which i struggled to transfer over to the React framework.
- I spent most of the time trying to start off my counter and cookies per second using useState and useEffect but i had to do a lot of researching to get this to work
- I had a lot of issues with git and i had to scrap my initial project template that i had been working on and start anew Sunday morning üò≠.
- To save time, i copied and pasted my styling from my previous project so that i could spend more time trying to understand the basic react concepts.
- I still don't feel very confident using useState and useEffect, but the basics work enough to meet some of the user requirements
- The constraint of time meant that i didn't get to the point where i could set/ get data from local storage.
- From this weeks assignment, i don't think react is a framework i prefer over vanilla javascript yet but i think it's because a lot of my weekend was spent trying to understand what was going on and not actually making something
- I am so grateful that i was able to get help from classmates this week to meet an MVP because I found it quite challenging.
